# How to Add Your Logo Image

## 📁 Exact Folder Location

Put your logo image file in this exact location:

```
public/images/gharse-logo.png
```

## ✅ Supported File Formats

You can use any of these formats:
- `gharse-logo.png` (recommended)
- `gharse-logo.jpg`
- `gharse-logo.jpeg`
- `gharse-logo.svg`

**Just make sure the filename is exactly:** `gharse-logo` (with the appropriate extension)

## 📝 Steps

1. **Navigate to:** `/Users/rbantu/bantus-kitchen/public/images/`
2. **Place your logo file there** with the name `gharse-logo.png` (or .jpg, .svg)
3. **That's it!** The logo will automatically appear across your entire site

## 🎯 Current Status

The Logo component is now set to **automatically use your image file** if it exists in that folder. If the image file is not found, it will fall back to the SVG logo.

## 📍 Full Path

**Absolute path on your Mac:**
```
/Users/rbantu/bantus-kitchen/public/images/gharse-logo.png
```

**Relative path from project root:**
```
public/images/gharse-logo.png
```

**Note:** After adding your image, you may need to restart your Next.js dev server for it to pick up the new file.
